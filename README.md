   git clone https://github.com/koushik-vardhan-B/credit-scoring-model.git
   cd credit-scoring-model


## Data
 - The dataset used in this project is available in the data/raw/ directory. The dataset includes features such as income, credit history, loan amount, etc.
## Model
 - The trained credit scoring model is saved in the models/ directory as credit_model.pkl. This model has achieved an accuracy of 0.79, indicating a high level of predictive performance. It can be used to predict the creditworthiness of new individuals.
